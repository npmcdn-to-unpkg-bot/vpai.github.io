At long last, I finally have my own webpage! It's been on my TODO list for ages now, so I'm thrilled that it's finally live. I had a
lot of fun putting it together, but more on that below.

<br>

There are two reasons that I decided it was important for me to start this blog. The first reason is to keep a running record of 
my life, not only for the purpose of remembering events, thoughts, and emotions, but also for understanding how my thought process changes 
as I grow older. The second is to become a better writer, and more articulate in expressing myself. I hope that this blog becomes my creative
space, because I haven't felt creative for a while. This will be an all purpose blog -- everything from life events to technical tidbits 
to travel tips to things that I want to remember to teach my kids will be included.
