title: Teaching in Prison
---

Tomorrow I will step inside the boundaries of San Quentin State Prison for the first time. I'll be going as a member of a DeCal offered at Berkeley called _Teach in Prison_. DeCals are student run classes that address niche topics, ranging from _The Wonderful Wizarding World of Harry Potter_ to _Chamber Music For Fun_, and everything in between. This particular class is a partnership between Berkeley and San Quentin through which students are given the opportunity to tutor inmates in math and english once a week.

#### <u>Our Gameplan is Wrong</u>

While waiting for the prison to finish the logistical work needed for us to start tutoring (mostly background checks, which are taking _forever_), as a class we have explored the Prison Industrial Complex and the major human rights issues associated with the prison system in the US. Most recently, we discussed the growing rate of [recidivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism), a term that I was previously unfamiliar with. According to [this](http://www.thenation.com/article/time-end-recidivism) article, the national recidivsm rate is 67%, a figure which I found shocking to learn. This is evidence that our current strategy for dealing with criminals is broken. We lock them up, fail to provide them with avenues for rehabilitation, release them, and then expect them to be less risky to society. Huh? California spends more money on prison than higher education, and a large chunk of this money goes towards construction, staffing, and security. Instead, I think time and money can be utilized more effectivley if channeled towards two things: 

1. Rehabilitation measures for the incarcerated, mostly education and job training. Funding for these types of programs is simply not enough. When inmates are freed, they return to the economy as unskilled labor. Even with basic skills, many are often discriminated against by employers because their criminal history (you've seen the checkbox on job apps). If that isn't hard enough to deal with, consider the fact that they may not have anyone to come back to. Husbands, wives, children, parents, friends - they may move on. Both economically and socially, freed inmates barely have a shot. No wonder they return back behind bars with such high frequency. 

2. Fixing systemic causes of crime - in particular, better education in low income communities. I think a quote from a New York Times [article] on the topic says it all: "for black men in their 20s and early 30s without a high school diploma, the incarceration rate is so high - nearly 40 percent nationwide - that they're more likely to be behind bars than to have a job". 

Consider Norway, where the recidivism rate is 20%. How are they doing it? One way is by creating a prison experience that resembles life outside prison. Case in point: Halden Prison, where each prison "cell" is equipped with a television, refigerator, designer furtinure, and more. Did I mention the jogging trails and state of art sports facilities? Of course, it's hard to imagine such a system working in the States because the poverty rate here is so high. Regardless, it's good to know that things are working elsewhere in the world. Maybe it's time that we learn a thing or two from them.

The goal of prisons in society is to reduce crime and make society a safer place, and as it stands what we're doing isn't working. In order to make meaningful progress in the right direction, it's important that we rethink the ways we currently use resources allocated towards this complex system. It's one of the only ways we can stop the cycles of crime that millions of Americans find themselves in.  

#### <u>Bringing Tech to San Quentin</u>

My favorite part of _Teach in Prison_ so far has been the guest speakers. I particularly enjoyed listening to Chris Redlitz, an entrepreneur and investor in the Silicon Valley who spoke to us about a program that he started four years ago called [The Last Mile](http://www.thelastmile.org).

Chris started off by telling us how years ago he would drive by San Quentin on a daily basis without thinking twice about what went on inside and how he could make positive change there. One day, he began to realize how difficult it was for prisoners to succeed after transitioning from prison back to the free world. In light of this, he decided he would help empower these individuals by exposing them to business and entrepreneurial skills to provide a sense of hope for living a fulfilling life after prison. That's what lead him to create the _The Last Mile_.

Chris's program teaches selected inmates the skills mentioned above (with an emphasis on technology) over a six month period. In addition, participants of the program are able to contribute regularly to social media sites such as Quora. Of course, they themselves aren't allowed to access the Internet. Questions are printed, then taken in to the prison, answered, taken out, and then posted back on the Internet. On Quora, _Last Mile_ participants have answered questions such as "How does it feel to murder someone?", giving us a remarkable glimpse into their world and thoughts. As a final project, participants are required to come up with business plans that involve a technology component and a social cause. About a month ago, the program held it's first ever Demo Day, where participants presented their plans to an audience which included top Silicon Valley CEOs and the press. Here is a video summarizing the event:

The most remarkable part about the Last Mile program is that the participants create high tech business plans without having access to any high tech. Think about someone who has been prison for 20 years. What does the Internet mean to them? Mobile? Social media? Nothing!

Chris's talk was incredibly inspirational for me. I admire him for choosing to use his influence and resources to make such a big difference to a population that is invisible to most people. I only hope I'm able to have an equally meaningful impact throughout my own career.

#### <u>#Excited</u>

I'm thrilled about finally going to San Quentin on Monday. Surprisingly, no part of me is the least bit nervous or scared. I think it's because I know that these people are no different from us out here in the free world. Sure, they've done terrible things, but that doesn't make them any less human. In fact, that's my goal: to treat them like I would anyone else. I think that's secretly what they want. I know I would.

It's going to be an amazing experience, I really can't wait.
