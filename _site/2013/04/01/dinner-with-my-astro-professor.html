			<h3 id="post_title">Dinner With My Astro Professor</h3>

<p>Earlier tonight I had the opportunity of eating dinner with my astronomy professor Alex Fillipenko and the rest of the course staff. A group of ten students, including myself, was invited to the meal because each of us had found the &#8220;easter egg&#8221; that Alex had hidden in the course reader before any of the other students in the class of 300+. The embedded note that we found read something like:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;If you&#8217;re reading this, contact your GSI now! You have a chance of having dinner with Alex and the GSIs of Astro C10. Honor code applies - don&#8217;t tell your friends.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The idea was that students who were motivated enough to read ahead were rewarded with this opportunity. I, on the other hand, shamelessly found it by chance during the first week of school while randomly flipping through the pages.</p>

<p>The dinner, which was held at La Val&#8217;s, was a blast. We talked about everything from The Hobbit to a book called <em>The Dune</em> to type 1a supernovae. I also met some awesome people that I would have never crossed paths with otherwise. Those are my favorite types of encounters. Towards the end, Alex left us with an anecdote:</p>

<p>When he was a graduate student at Cal Tech, he recalls his lengthy dissertation defense. In the weeks leading up to the defense, he had given physical copies of his disseration to each of the four examiners who he would present to. In each copy, he left an &#8220;easter egg&#8221; promising the reader a prize if he or she brought it up during the defense. When the day arrived, Alex asked &#8220;Does anyone want to claim their prize?&#8221;, only to receive puzzled looks. Even his own advisor (who called him Popsicle) hadn&#8217;t read his work from start to finish. Alex told us that this is why he reads every dissertation he is chosen to evaluate thoroughly, and also that this incident was part of the movitation for putting the line quoted above in our course reader.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m a teacher, I am going to try my very best to emulate the qualities and teaching styles of Alex Fillipenko. He brings the energy, humor, and passion that are necessary not only to communicate ideas effectively, but also to excite and inspire his students. His willingness to go the extra mile is what him makes him one of the best professors I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
